# Kitab-Social-Privacy-Policy
**Last updated:** October 2025

Thank you for using **Kitab Social**. Your privacy matters. This Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

---

## 1) Information We Collect

**Account & Profile.** Email, username, display name, photo, bio, and other profile details you provide.

**User Content.** Posts, comments, reactions, messages, and media you upload.  
- Direct messages are encrypted in transit and at rest. Where supported, one-to-one messages use end-to-end encryption so only sender and recipient can read them.

**Social Graph.** Follows/followers, blocks/mutes, and other in-app relationships.

**Duplicate-Image Detection Data.**  
- To reduce spam, when you upload an image we compute a non-reversible perceptual hash (an image ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù).  
- The same image may be uploaded twice; a third attempt is blocked automatically.  
- We store only the fingerprint and minimal counters needed to enforce this rule. We do **not** share these fingerprints with third parties.

**Device & Usage.** App version, OS, crash logs, diagnostics, coarse analytics (e.g., feature usage counts). We do **not** use this for cross-app tracking or advertising.

**Optional Signals.** Approximate location (if you enable location features in a post), contacts discovery (only if you explicitly opt in), and push notification tokens.

**Cookies / Local Storage (web only).** For authentication, session continuity, and basic analytics.

## 2) How We Use Information

- Provide core social and messaging features (profiles, feeds, DMs).  
- Improve performance, reliability, safety, and moderation.  
- Enforce duplicate-image limits and other anti-abuse protections.  
- Communicate service notices (e.g., policy updates, incidents).  
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 3) Permissions We Request (iOS)

- **Camera** ‚Äì capture photos/videos to post or DM.  
- **Photo Library / Add** ‚Äì select and (if you choose) save media.  
- **Microphone** ‚Äì record video/audio messages (if you use these features).  
- **Notifications (optional)** ‚Äì message and activity alerts.  
- **Contacts (optional)** ‚Äì friend discovery, only if you opt in.

Permissions are requested only when needed. You can change them anytime in device Settings.

## 4) Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade your data. We share data only:  
- **With service providers** under contract (e.g., cloud hosting, crash analytics).  
- **For legal compliance** when required by law or valid process.  
- **For security** to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.

---

## 5) Security

We use encryption, access controls, and industry-standard safeguards. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve protections.

---

## 6) Data Retention

- **User Content** (posts, comments, messages): retained to provide the service until you delete it or delete your account.  
- **Duplicate-Image Fingerprints:** kept as long as necessary to enforce limits and protect the service; deleted when no longer needed or upon account deletion.  
- **Diagnostics:** retained for a limited period to improve stability.

---

## 7) Your Rights & Choices

- **Delete Account & Data:** **Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account** (if available) or contact us.  
- **Manage Content:** Delete your own posts, comments, and media in-app.  
- **Control Permissions:** Adjust in device Settings.
